# 🍽️ AI-Powered Kitchen Display System

## 📌 Overview
The AI-Powered Kitchen Display System (KDS) is a GenAI-inspired solution designed to optimize restaurant kitchen operations. It focuses on reducing kitchen latency by intelligently compressing orders and identifying recurring order patterns to improve preparation efficiency and coordination.

## ❓ Problem Statement
Traditional kitchen display systems present raw and unorganized order data. During peak hours, this leads to confusion, poor prioritization, delayed preparation, and inefficient communication between kitchen staff.

## 💡 Proposed Solution
This system introduces AI-inspired logic to:
- Group similar menu items
- Compress repetitive orders
- Predict cooking priorities
- Reduce screen clutter
- Improve kitchen workflow and response time

## 🧠 AI / GenAI Usage
Although not using heavy ML models, the system applies intelligent logic inspired by AI concepts:
- Pattern recognition on incoming orders
- Order compression using similarity rules
- Priority prediction based on preparation time
- Smart coordination for kitchen staff

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend:** Python (Flask)  
- **AI Logic:** Rule-based pattern intelligence  
- **Tools:** GitHub, VS Code
